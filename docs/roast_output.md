# ROAST Output Summary

Below is a summary of the outputs generated by ROAST. More information can be found in the [ROAST documentation about output files](https://github.com/andypotatohy/roast?tab=readme-ov-file#5-outputs-of-roast-software).

ROAST generates a variety of outputs for each simulation, grouped into the following categories:

## Log File
subjName_roastLog:
A text log containing full simulation history. Each run is identified by its unique simulationTag, and all configuration options are recorded here.

## Figure Outputs
ROAST generates 7–8 figures for quick visualization:

- Slice views of T1/T2 MRI and tissue segmentation.

- 3D renderings of the computed voltage and electric field distributions.

- Slice views of voltage and electric field in voxel space.

In the slice views, both voxel and MNI coordinates are shown for any point clicked, marked with a small circle.

Note: slice views are in model voxel space, while 3D renderings are in world space.

## MATLAB Outputs (.mat)
subjName_simulationTag_roastResult.mat contains:

- vol_all: voltage at each voxel in the model voxel space, unit: mV

- ef_all: electric field vector at each voxel (3 volumes for x-, y-, z-components), unit: V/m

- ef_mag: magnitude of the electric field at each voxel, unit: V/m

## NIfTI Outputs (.nii)
- subjName_simulationTag_v.nii – voltage, unit: mV

- subjName_simulationTag_e.nii – electric field vector magnitude, unit: V/m

- subjName_simulationTag_emag.nii – electric field magnitude, unit: V/m

Note: Starting from ROAST v3.5, ROAST also outputs:

MRI and segmentation mask files aligned to MNI space, with filenames ending in _MNI.nii

## Text File Outputs (.pos)
- subjName_simulationTag_v.pos – voltage at each mesh node, unit: mV

- subjName_simulationTag_e.pos – electric field at each mesh node, unit: V/m

These values are defined at mesh node locations found in the corresponding mesh files (*.msh or *.mat).

Mesh node coordinates are in model voxel space, scaled by the MRI header, and thus reported in millimeters (mm).
